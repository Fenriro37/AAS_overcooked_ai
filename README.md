# AAS_overcooked_ai
This project implements the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to train cooperative agents in the Overcooked-AI gym environment.

- 2mill_run_weights/: Contains the saved model weights for the policy and value networks after training.
- evaluation_videos/: Stores gameplay videos generated by evaluating the trained agents.
- AAS_report.pdf: The final project report detailing the implementation, experiments, and results.
- agent.py: Implements the core MAPPO agent, including the replay buffer, advantage calculation, and the main training loop.
- environment.py: A wrapper for the Overcooked-AI gym environment.
- main.ipynb: The main Notebook used to explore hyperparameters, launch training, and evaluate the trained models.
- models.py: Defines the neural network architectures for the actor (policy) and critic (value) networks using TensorFlow/Keras.
- utils.py: Contains helper functions for plotting training results, rendering evaluation games, and other miscellaneous tasks.
